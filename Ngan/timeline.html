<h3>1.	Before our interview for immigration visa (before June 30th, 2017)</h3>
<h4>1.1.	My first trip to Vietnam: December 24th, 2015 to January 20th, 2016</h4>

<li>I knew Ngan Thi Tran from <a href="http://vietsingle.com/" target="_blank"> http://vietsingle.com/</a> when I was in hometown (Quy Nhon city, Binh Dinh, Vietnam). I was impressed by her profile and pictures and decided to contact her. I obtained her email using vietsingle Gold Account service (please see the <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Vietsingle.png" target="_blank"> vietsingle receipt </a> registered on my personal email ). I did this to bypass <i>vietsingle</i> as the middle man and to avoid limitations using standard services (limits 3 emails/day)
 . </li>

 <li>Then I created another email (instead of using my personal email nhontuan@gmail.com) under the name<i> Nguyen H</i> since <i>vietsingle</i> is not reliable with many spams and I did not want to reveal my identity. I sent Ngan Thi Tran the first email on <b>December 28th, 2015</b>.  And she replied. Please find my introduction email and Ngan’s response <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/VietsingleMail.png" target="_blank"> here</a>. </li>

 <li>As indicated in the email, Ngan suggested to talk on <a href="https://www.tango.me/">tango</a>, a free video call & chat service. As a computer geek, I can easily find Ngan on <a href="https://www.tango.me/">tango</a> by searching for her email (even though this was the first time I heard about it).
Unfortunately, we have deleted our vietsingle profiles as well as all tango conversations (after returning the U.S., we have been using Skype to talk). The <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/VietsingleMail.png" target="_blank"> introduction email</a> is the only evidence that we still kept before setting up our first meeting in person.  </li>

<li> On the first of <b>January, 2016</b>, I met Ngan Thi Tran in <b>Da Nang city, Vietnam</b> (which is 5 hours by train from Quy Nhon city). Ngan picked me up at the Da Nang Railway Station around 2pm to <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tuong-vi.vi.html" target="_blank"> Tường Vy hotel</a>. In the evening of the same date, we went to a concert by Heniken in Han river, Da Nang. After the concert, Ngan took me back Tường Vy hotel and she came back to her place. On the second day, we then drove to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298085-d7118743-Reviews-Linh_Ung_Pagoda-Da_Nang_Quang_Nam_Province.html" target="_blank">Linh Ung Temple</a> and decided to go together to Hue city the next day. In morning of <b>January 3rd</b>, we drove to <b>Hue city</b> by motorbike (it took us about 3 hours driving) and stayed at Gold Hotel in Hue city (please find my booking on Agoda at Gold Hotel <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Agoda_Hue.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>).    </li>       

<li>I learned a lot about Ngan within 2 days in Hue city. We had our best memories here. We discovered the best <i>Banh Canh</i> in Hue with a very funny name “O Bướm” close to Đông Ba market. The price was 10,000 VND/serving, we were so surprise about that. We walked on the side way of <i>Huong river</i> and found a Human statue that Ngan convinced me “It is a real statue”. Somehow I trusted her and hit the Human statue in his arm. But Human statue started moving, this made us scared, laughed, and ran away. 
</li>

<li>Overall, two days in Hue was a great time that I found a lot of funs spending time with Ngan. Ngan is a very sweet and caring person. This helped me to forget about my broken marriage in Chicago.  
On the <b>5th of January, 2016</b>, we drove back to <b>Da Nang city</b>. Ngan’s motorbike got broken on the way back so I had to take the night train back to Quy Nhon City (instead of the 2pm train as planned).</li>

<li>Four days later, I came back Da Nang city to learn more about Ngan. She had told me more about her family and her ex-boyfriend. In <b>Hoi An</b> (45-mitnute driving from Da Nang city), I decided to tell Ngan about my broken marriage and how much I suffered from it. I received the sharing from Ngan and I remember that she was holding my hand in the entire time. We spent the whole night on Pham Van Dong beach, Da Nang city as I had tons of stories about my broken marriage to tell her. My second trip to Da Nang was not as happy as the first trip but I was a huge release from me since I have found a person to share the troubles that I had in my marriage. </li>

<li>We met the third time in <b>Quy Nhon city</b> (Ngan took the same train to visit my hometown). I had a chance to tell her about the city, my secondary school, and my childhood. I also told her about my family plan in opening a private hospital which is a joint business of my mom, uncle 9, and uncle 5. There was a disagreement in stock sharing. I asked Ngan to do the calculation to make sure that my mom receives the fair investment sharing (Ngan had experiences in accounting). Unpurposely, I challenged Ngan to work in my family and take care of my mom as well as to help her business. Ngan immediately accepted in my surprise. </li> 

<li>At 6pm on the 18th of January 2016, I and Ngan took a train to Ho Chi Minh City. On the 19th of January 2016, I took the flight to come back to the U.S. while Ngan took another flight to come back to Da Nang city. 

We then kept in touch on Skype (as indicated on the right picture).
