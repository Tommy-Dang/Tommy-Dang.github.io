<center><h3>TIMELINE OF OUR RELATIONSHIP</h3></center>

This is our revised timeline which contains more details and evidences than <a href="/docs/round2/TimelineTommy.pdf" target="_blank"> the submitted timeline</a> on July 6, 2017 at the U.S. Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City. For example, <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Picture1.png" target="_blank"> here is the screenshot</a> which shows how I obtained Ngan's email and phone number through <a href="http://vietsingle.com/" target="_blank"> vietsingle</a> Gold Account service.

<h3>1.	Before our interview for immigration visa (before June 30th, 2017)</h3>
<h4>1.1.	My first trip to Vietnam: December 24th, 2015 to January 20th, 2016</h4>

<li>I knew Ngan Thi Tran from <a href="http://vietsingle.com/" target="_blank"> http://vietsingle.com/</a> when I was in hometown (Quy Nhon city, Binh Dinh, Vietnam). I was impressed by her profile and pictures and decided to contact her. I obtained her email using vietsingle Gold Account service (please see the <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Vietsingle.png" target="_blank"> vietsingle receipt </a> registered on my personal email ). I did this to bypass <i>vietsingle</i> as the middle man and to avoid limitations using standard services (limits 3 emails/day)
 . </li>

 <li>Then I created another email (instead of using my personal email nhontuan@gmail.com) under the name<i> Nguyen H</i> since <i>vietsingle</i> is not reliable with many spams and I did not want to reveal my identity. I sent Ngan Thi Tran the first email on <b>December 28th, 2015</b>.  And she replied. Please find my introduction email and Ngan’s response <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/VietsingleMail.png" target="_blank"> here</a>. </li>

 <li>As indicated in the email, Ngan suggested to talk on <a href="https://www.tango.me/">tango</a>, a free video call & chat service. As a computer geek, I can easily find Ngan on <a href="https://www.tango.me/">tango</a> by searching for her email (even though this was the first time I heard about it).
Unfortunately, we have deleted our vietsingle profiles as well as all tango conversations (after returning the U.S., we have been using Skype to talk). The <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/VietsingleMail.png" target="_blank"> introduction email</a> is the only evidence that we still kept before setting up our first meeting in person.  </li>

<li> On the first of <b>January, 2016</b>, I met Ngan Thi Tran in <b>Da Nang city, Vietnam</b> (which is 5 hours by train from Quy Nhon city). Ngan picked me up at the Da Nang Railway Station around 2pm to <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/tuong-vi.vi.html" target="_blank"> Tường Vy hotel</a>. In the evening of the same date, we went to a concert by Heniken in Han river, Da Nang. After the concert, Ngan took me back Tường Vy hotel and she came back to her place. On the second day, we then drove to <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g298085-d7118743-Reviews-Linh_Ung_Pagoda-Da_Nang_Quang_Nam_Province.html" target="_blank">Linh Ung Temple</a> and decided to go together to Hue city the next day. In morning of <b>January 3rd</b>, we drove to <b>Hue city</b> by motorbike (it took us about 3 hours driving) and stayed at Gold Hotel in Hue city (please find my booking on Agoda at Gold Hotel <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Agoda_Hue.pdf" target="_blank"> here</a>).    </li>       

<li>I learned a lot about Ngan within 2 days in Hue city. We had our best memories here. We discovered the best <i>Banh Canh</i> in Hue with a very funny name “O Bướm” close to Đông Ba market (see <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Picture3.jpg" target="_blank"> the picture taken at “O Bướm”</a>). The price was 10,000 VND/serving, we were so surprise about that. We walked on the side way of <i>Huong river</i> and found a Human statue that Ngan convinced me “It is a real statue”. Somehow I trusted her and hit the Human statue in his arm. But Human statue started moving, this made us scared, laughed, and ran away. 
</li>

<li>Overall, two days in Hue was a great time that I found a lot of funs spending time with Ngan. Ngan is a very sweet and caring person. This helped me to forget about my broken marriage in Chicago.  
On the <b>5th of January, 2016</b>, we drove back to <b>Da Nang city</b>. Ngan’s motorbike got broken on the way back so I had to take the night train back to Quy Nhon City (instead of the 2pm train as planned).</li>

<li>Four days later, I came back Da Nang city to learn more about Ngan. She had told me more about her family and her ex-boyfriend. In <b>Hoi An</b> (45-mitnute driving from Da Nang city), I decided to tell Ngan about my broken marriage and how much I suffered from it. I received the sharing from Ngan and I remember that she was holding my hand in the entire time. We spent the whole night on Pham Van Dong beach, Da Nang city as I had tons of stories about my broken marriage to tell her. My second trip to Da Nang was not as happy as the first trip but I was a huge release from me since I have found a person to share the troubles that I had in my marriage. </li>

<li>We met the third time in <b>Quy Nhon city</b> (Ngan took the same train to visit my hometown). I had a chance to tell her about the city, my secondary school, and my childhood. I also told her about my family plan in opening a private hospital which is a joint business of my mom, uncle 9, and uncle 5. There was a disagreement in stock sharing. I asked Ngan to do the calculation to make sure that my mom receives the fair investment sharing (Ngan had experiences in accounting). Unpurposely, I challenged Ngan to work in my family and take care of my mom as well as to help her business. Ngan immediately accepted in my surprise. <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Picture4.png" target="_blank"> This picture</a> shows that we also emailed about the stock sharing of my family business.
</li> 

<li>At 6pm on <b>January 18, 2016</b>, I and Ngan took a train to <b>Ho Chi Minh City</b>. On <b> January 19, 2016</b>, I took the flight to come back to the U.S. while Ngan took another flight to come back to Da Nang city. 

We then kept in touch on <i>Skype</i> (as indicated in <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Picture5.png" target="_blank"> this picture</a>).
</li> 


<li>After the <b>lunar new year of 2016</b>, I was able to convince my mom to accept Ngan to work in our house in <b>Quy Nhon city</b>. I introduced Ngan as a younger sister of my friend, and their family was in a financial difficulty. Ngan entered my home with a faked name, <i>Mai</i>, and worked as a house keeper (her salary was only 3,000,000 VND per month). Our intentions were 1) Ngan can help me to keep track of investment sharing of my family business 2) Ngan can take care of my mom and 3) Ngan learn about my mom business (buying and selling shrimps). Ngan did a good job on 1) and 2) but not 3) since she needed more time to gain trust from my mom. However after <b>2.5 months</b>, my mom became skeptical about Ngan since Ngan was so much smarter than a normal house keeper. My mom started to change her feelings about Ngan (known as <i>Mai</i> at that point) since she thought Ngan was a liar who entering the house for a different purpose and Ngan was part of my decision of withdrawing the investment on the private hospital (my mom really wants to help Uncle 9 who is a doctor). I could not explain this to my mom since I could not reveal our relationship. After that, Ngan left <b>Quy Nhon city</b> and came back to <b>Da Nang city</b>. In summary, Ngan entered my family with good intentions which did not turn out well and this really hurts what my mom thinks about Ngan. </li>

<li>
	Meanwhile, my marriage got deeper and deeper into arguments about money (and benefits for her family, including her parents, sister, and brothers). Here is <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/K1/argument.m4a" target="_blank"> an example </a> of a night in my marriage life. I proposed to my ex-wife (<i>Amy Pham</i>, phone number <b> (+1) 312-662-3174 </b>) to terminate this troublesome marriage due to the following reasons:

	<ol type="1">
	  <li>I have suffered from this since the end of 2011 and could not find a way to resolve it. I did not receive any sharings/understanding from Amy, my ex-wife.</li>
	  <li>I accepted an offer to be an Assistant Professor at Texas Tech University. I wanted to start a new life in a new city.</li>
	  <li>A lot of arguments (and actions) happened in front of my son (I tried to avoid these circumstances). My son needs a normal life that he can go to school in the morning and have funs instead of listenning and seeing arguments between dad and mom.</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<!--1.2 *********************    -->
<h4> 1.2. My second trip to Vietnam: July 20th, 2016 to August 20th, 2016 </h4>

<li> I made another trip back Vietnam on <b>July 20, 2016</b>. I went to <b>Da Nang city</b> to visit Ngan on <b>July 24th</b>. Ngan has helped me to recover from the most difficult time in my life. The following picture was taken at Linh Ung temple (the first time that she agreed to have a picture together).
	<center><img src="pics/July2016/2016_DaNang.jpg" width="70%" alt="2016_DaNang" /></center>
</li>	


<li>On <b>the 26th of July,2016</b>, we started to travel together to <b>Hue city</b> (<b>27th of July 2016</b>, please see the booking <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Agoda_Hue2.png" target="_blank"> here</a>)), <b>Dong Hoi city</b>, Quang Binh (<b>28th of July, 2016</b>, please see the booking <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Agoda_DongHoi.png" target="_blank"> here</a>)), and then <b>Vinh City</b>, Nghe An (<b>29th of July 2016</b>, please see the booking <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Agoda_Vinh.png" target="_blank"> here</a>)), and then <b>Dien Phong</b>, Dien Chau, Nghe An (this is the first time that I visit Ngan family). While staying in Ngan’s hometown, we made a trip to visit a poor family (of Nguyen Van Nguyen) in Hamlet 9, Nam Lâm, Diễn Lâm, Diễn Châu, Nghệ An (see the picture below).
	<center><img src="pics/July2016/Picture6.png" width="70%" alt="2016_DaNang" /></center>
</li>

<li>
	After a few days, we left Nghe An to go to <b>Pleiku, Gia Lai</b>. I visited another special family who needs helps. <i>Mr. Phuoc</i> and his family host 84 mental patients (at the point of visit in August 2016) without supports from the government. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-rq8yMFekQ&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank"> This video</a> captures our visit. 
	<!--The following picture was capture at Tra Cung Dinh, Pleiku, Gia Lai.
		<center><img src="pics/July2016/Picture6.png" width="70%" alt="2016_DaNang" /></center>-->
</li>

<li>
We then came back to Quy Nhon city, my hometown. After a few more days, we went to <b>Dalat city</b>, Lam Dong. We were notified that Ngan’s grand-father passed away on our way to Dalat city. We had to take a flight back to <b>Vinh city</b> and then came back Dien Phong, Dien Chau, Nghe An.  
</li>

<li>
On <b>August 13, 2016</b>, we took a flight from Vinh city to <b>Pleiku city</b> (please see the booking <a href="https://github.com/Tommy-Dang/Tommy-Dang.github.io/blob/master/Ngan/pics/picsRound2/Picture7.png" target="_blank"> here</a>), Gia Lai and then took a bus to <b>Quy Nhon city</b>. The following pictures were taken at <b>Trung Luong, Cát Tiến</b>, Bình Định (an hour driving from Quy Nhon city, I used my family car to make this trip).

  </tr>
</table>

</li>

<li>
<b><u>Our relationship became serious:</u></b> <br>
The trips help me to realize that she is my soulmate. I verbally proposed that we will be together for the rest of our lives. We both understand that this is not easy since we will not receive supports from my family. We did not have much time left, so we decided to take the pre-wedding photos on the August 17th, 2016 (3 days before my flight back the U.S.). Here is our <a href='https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMAS6O61VvZ9iUIzh88cul7fDc8st-tO75g2qA1zGuRrrnZcYZEzbz6IguvwWqGrg?key=Vk5zVXhZWHVIdU9rTkVUbkNocTVqc05vTHNzYmxB&source=ctrlq.org' target="_blank"> pre-wedding photo collection</a>.

    <td><img src="pics/July2016/Picture9.png" width="100%" alt="Trung Luong" /></td> 
  </tr>
</table>

<br>

</li>

<li>On the <b>19th of August 2016</b>, we flew to <b>Ho Chi Minh city</b> for my flight back to the U.S. on the next day (see <a href="pics/July2016/Picture11.png" target="_blank"> Tommy's</a> and <a href="pics/July2016/Picture12.png" target="_blank"> Ngan's</a>  boarding passes).
</li> 
<li>
	After I got back to the U.S., my ex-wife learned that I knew Ngan by hacking into my Skype. Consequently, my ex-wife made the divorce process more difficult: 
	<ol type="1">
	  <li>She asked to transfer our house in Chicago to her name (we were the joint owner at that time, which was then transfered to her name).</li>
	  <li>She asked to transfer all money in my checking to her bank account (I agreed and did that).
</li>
	  <li>She asked to me to provide child support which is equivalent to 30% of my salary (I agree and have been doing that after divorce).
</li>
	</ol>
</li>
<li>
I informed Ngan about these conditions and the fact that I will be empty-handed after divorce (except my current job at <i>Texas Tech University</i>). Ngan accepted that and agreed to be with me. 
I have accepted all my wife requests above and my marriage was officially terminated on <b>December 20th, 2016</b>.
</li>

<li>
My mom was aware of my divorce. But my mom did not like me to get married with Ngan since the think that Ngan want to be with me for the financial reason. Moreover, my mom want my spouse to be at the same level as mine: similar education, similar occupation. I did not agree with my mom because during the time that I know Ngan I can felt that Ngan is the girl that I am looking for. For this reason, the relationship between me and my mom was damaged. 
</li>
<li>
I submitted the petition for fiancé Visa on the <b>2nd of January 2017</b>.
</li>
<li>
	Again, Skype was the main channel for our communication. I also did not forget to send Ngan gifts on  <a href="pics/picsRound2/Picture13.png" target="_blank"> Valentine 2017</a> and the <a href="pics/picsRound2/Picture14.png" target="_blank"> International woman date</a> 2017.
</li>

<h4>1.3. My third trip to Vietnam: June 19 to July 10, 2017</h4>
<li>On <b>June 19th, 2017</b>, I came back <b>Vietnam</b> to see Ngan and to prepare for our interview (at the U.S. Consulate General Ho Chi Minh City on <b>June 30th, 2017</b>). I landed in <b>Ha Noi city</b>, Vietnam. We stayed at the Rising Dragon Estate Hotel (here is <a href="pics/2017/Picture25.png" target="_blank"> the receipt</a>).
</li>
<li>
On the next day, we took a bus to <b>Sapa</b> and stayed there for <b>4 days</b>. Together we toured Fansipan, Silver River, Bản Cát Cát, Bản Tả Van, and Sapa city center. <a href='https://goo.gl/photos/16hHg6R9asNdCat6A' target="_blank">  Many pictures of our trip has been taken</a>.
</li>
<li> On the <b>24th of June 2017</b>, we came back to <b>Hanoi city</b> for the soccer game between Ha Noi FC and Hai Phong FC (Please find our <a href="pics/2017/Picture28.png" target="_blank"> booking for Grab taxi</a>).
</li>
<li>
On the <b>25th of June 2017</b>, we took a train from Hanoi city to <b>Vinh City</b> , Nghe An. We stayed at Ngan’s Uncle house in Vinh city (Please find our <a href="pics/2017/Picture26.png" target="_blank"> train tickets</a>). 
</li>

<li>
<b><u>Our official proposal:</u></b> <br>
We asked her uncle wife (Hai Le, phone number 0983808863) to select a restaurant for our official proposal. In the evening of the <b>25th of June 2016</b>, together with Ngan’s Uncle family, I proposed and Ngan accepted (Please find the  <a href="https://www.cs.uic.edu/~tdang/K1/IMG_3382.MOV" target="_blank">video of our proposal</a>)
