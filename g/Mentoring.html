	<ul>
	    <li>I talked to <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/ceweb/faculty/faculty.php?name=Venkatesh%20Uddameri">Prof.Venkatesh Uddameri </a> and learned about this research (Groundwater Modeling). He talked about the opportunities of collaborations with many ideas: 
	    </li>
	    <ul>
	    	<li>Modeling water flows: What if I put a water pump or make a chanel in a certain location on a geographic area, how would the water go?</li>
	    	<li>Modeling water for education: Let the student to interact with a model, such as rain generation, to gain understanding about water flows</li>
	    	<li>Water is the basic elements for all living and manufactoring activities. It is very important to plan the use of water. Therefore, if we can make the prediction for the water availabilities in the next month or even only two days ahead and plan our activity together as a community. That will have a huge impact.</li>
	    	<li>Decision making: Righ now, when receiving a request from an agency, his group has to do the modeling offline and return results as a stactic mode. It it much more convincible for decision maker to interact (such as changing input parameters using a slider) with our water model, and see the outcome right away. </li>
	    </ul>
	    <br>
	    <ul> <b>For the next steps</b>:
	    	<li> I asked him to give some sample data as a homework and he send me the water level data in TX asking me to generate a water level visualization on the map to answer "what is the water level of my current GPS location?". So I am on that project</li>
	    	<li> I asked him to include me to his group meeting (this Friday).</li>
	    	<li> We planned for a trip to <a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/about/directory/suzanne-pierce">University of Texas at Austin</a> to meet collaborators there in January 2017 and another trip to Arizona state university to visit <a href="https://sustainability.asu.edu/dcdc/people/"> Decision Center for a Desert City</a> and <a href="http://vader.lab.asu.edu/"> VADER lab </a></li>
	    	<li> He planned to plug me in a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16524/nsf16524.htm"> NSF proposal in Innovations at the Nexus of Food, Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS)</a> in <b>March 2017</b>. He submited this proposal last year, made the cut but not fundded. He is planning to swich from Track 3 to Track 2 with the focus on visualization.</li>

	    	<li> He will also add me in aother <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16524/nsf16524.htm"> National Institute of Food and Agriculture proposal</a> due in <b>July 2017</b> in Agriculture and Food Research Initiative - Water for Agriculture Challenge Area.
	   	</ul>
	    <br>
	    <ul> 
	    He has an old smaller <b>hyperwall</b> in his office. And he said it was useful for him.
	    </ul>
	    <br>
	    
	    <li>I also tried to meet <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/pe/faculty/faculty.php?name=Marshall%20Watson">Prof.Marshall Watson<a> twice but failed
	    </li>
	    
	     <li>I set up a meeting tomorrow with <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/biotechnologyandgenomics/about/staff/chiquito.php">Prof.Chiquito Crasto<a></li>

	     <li>You mentioned about brain visualization. Do you know any experts in brain analysis at TTU?</li>

	     <li>What is the best way to get in touch with <a href="http://www.depts.ttu.edu/che/faculty/faculty.php?name=Brandon%20Weeks">Prof.Brandon Weeks<a>. His research of interests are in nanotechnology, energetic material, and high explosives. </li>
	</ul>

	<ol>
	  <li>Grant proposals/collaborations:
	    <ul>
	    <li>Prof. Chauchyun Chen on Molecular Dynamic simulation.</li>
	    <li>Set up a meet with Arvind Ramanathan for the last week of October.</li>
	    <li> Working with <a href="https://sols.asu.edu/people/nico-franz">Prof.Nico Franz <a> on a proposal
	    <p style="margin-left: 30px">
	    This is my idea about grant submission: Nico and Beltram's group use <a href="https://github.com/EulerProject">Euler</a> as a logic-based reasoning model to compare/analyze two input classifications based on some predefined rules by experts. 
	    Dr. Hong Cui focuses more on similarities and differences of biological characteristics of organisms to come up the taxonomic classifications:  
	    <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/public/images/0/08/ETC-ProjectDescription.pdf"> ETC proposal</a>, <a href="http://taxonconceptexplorer.org/pub/Main_Page"> ETC site</a>, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1147266"> NFS 1147266</a>, and 
	    <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1643002"> NSF 1643002</a>.
	    <br>
	    
		My idea is to extract the hierarchical structures of species from articles, journal papers, and other reliable resources such as <a href="https://www.dataone.org/"> dataOne </a>(using text mining). After having the extracted hierarchies (of course with many conflicting knowledges and ambiguities), we can compare/analyze with existing classifications to try to resolve these ambiguities/conflicting evidences. Visualizations can greatly help with this process.
